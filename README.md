Purpose: Implementing Machine learning algorithm from scratch to get a broader understading of how these work:

We will strive to make all the algorithms use the 
[Tidy Data Paradigm](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html "Hadley Wickham's Tidy Data").
So unless else stated you should be able to fit any tidy dataset. More on this to come.
